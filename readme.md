## NOTE
2023/03/07: in the orignal dataset of DRIVE, the labels of test dataset in note avaible. I have download them in [GitHubLink](https://github.com/Libo-Xu/DRIVE--Digital-Retinal-Images-for-Vessel-Extraction/tree/master/DRIVE/test/1st_manual)

## confusion
2023/03/07: I temporarily abandon the val_loader which means all of the data in training folder will be used in the training process

2023/03/17: In the cleansing for STARE, i use padding impled by myself, there may be somthing wrong

## TODO
2023/03/07: fix the code style of the cleasing process in main.py
